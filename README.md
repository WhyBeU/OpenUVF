## Overview

OpenUVF is a software utility developed by Southern Company R&D, a subdivision of Southern Company Services, Inc., to automatically analyze Ultraviolet Fluorescence (UVF) images of solar PV modules. It is imagined as a foundation, upon which UVF can be developed as a practical inspection technique complementing existing PV inspection techniques like Electroluminescence and Thermography.

OpenUVF is intended for research and development purposes. It is a work in progress, and may not work for your application or on your system. We hope you find it useful, though!
