## Overview

OpenUVF is a software utility developed by Southern Company R&D, a subdivision of Southern Company Services, Inc., to automatically analyze Ultraviolet Fluorescence (UVF) images of solar PV modules. It is imagined as a foundation, upon which UVF can be developed as a practical inspection technique complementing existing PV inspection techniques like Electroluminescence and Thermography.

OpenUVF is intended for research and development purposes. It is a work in progress, and may not work for your application or on your system. We hope you find it useful, though!

This software requires a number of items, including:
*MATLAB (and the Image Processing Toolbox)
*[LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) or a similar annotation tool with PASCAL VOC format
*Python 3, Anaconda, and several packages described in our documentation [here](https://github.com/williamhobbs/OpenUVF/tree/master/docs).
*[TensorFLow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), and for training new models, NVIDIA GPU hardware and described in our documentation [here](https://github.com/williamhobbs/OpenUVF/tree/master/docs).

A portion of TensorFlow, specifically the [Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection), is redistributed with OpenUVF. TensorFlow is a Google product and is licensed under [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/LICENSE).
